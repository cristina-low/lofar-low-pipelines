# lofar-low-pipelines
A place where I put all the pipelines that I design for calibrating lofar data below 40 MHz. They are particularly made for noisy data, taken in the solar maximum.

Beware, there can be bugs and mistakes, as all this is a work in progress. Let me know if you find any problems.
